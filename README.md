Reports

The PDF reports use [Thinreports](http://www.thinreports.org) to help organize and create the reports.

You should use the [Thinreports Editor](http://www.thinreports.org/features/editor/) to edit these reports. The reports can be edited in a text editor as well, but it's helpful to use the GUI editor. There are versions for all platforms.
